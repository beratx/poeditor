Po Editor
---------
Po Editor is a modified (and very simplified) version of Diagramo - pure HTML5 
JavaScript diagram / flowchart editor http://diagramo.com

It's a simple web based editor to design Parte Operativa(PO) of synchronous 
sequential networks (a concept belongs to computer architecture). 

It's an old project that I made for a course and tested just with Firefox.
You can simply download and launch it, no requires installation.
