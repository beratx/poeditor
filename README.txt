Po Editor is a modified (and very simplified) version of Diagramo - pure HTML5 
JavaScript diagram / flowchart editor http://diagramo.com

It's a simple web based editor to design Parte Operativa(PO) of synchronous 
sequential networks (a concept belongs to computer architecture). 

You can simply download and launch it, no requires installation. 

It's an old project that I made for a course and tested just with Firefox.
